## Important Notes for Twitch
There 2 pending changes for the Twitch API:

The first involves IRC slash commands and 3rd party applications.
> As of Februray 24th, 2023, 3rd party apps will no longer be able to use IRC slash commands.  **Streamer.bot** has already been updated with support for the new API methods to perform these commands
{.is-warning}

The second, involves the old, undocumented API to retrieve a channels list of chatters.  Currently the Raid Event adds a `%raiderNames%` variable with information on who it thinks is part of the raid.  Because this end point is being retired, this variable will no longer be available, as there are no replacement methods that can be used publicly.
> As of April 3rd, 2023, the tmi endpoint for obtaining a channel's list of chatters will be removed, **Streamer.bot** will be removing the afformentioned `%raiderNames%` variable sometime in March with an update.
{.is-warning}

## New C# Methods
```cs
long TwitchGetBitsDonatedByUserId(string userId);
bool TwitchIsUserSubscribed(string userId, out string tier);
```

```cs
List<TwitchReward> TwitchGetRewards()
```
Structure of `TwitchReward`
```cs
public class TwitchReward
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Prompt { get; set; }
    public int Cost { get; set; }
    public bool InputRequired { get; set; }
    public string BackgroundColor { get; set; }
    public bool Paused { get; set; }
    public bool Enabled { get; set; }
    public bool IsOurs { get; set; }
}

```

## Twitch Game Categories
Trying to manage the games.dat file was starting to get out of hand, so with v0.1.18, it is gone completely, and in its place, when selecting specific games, you're able to perform realtime searches against Twitch's own categories, so you'll always have the most current data moving forward.

Internally, because of this change, some methods were also updated to handle the data file no longer existing.

## Twitch Data
### Twitch Bit Donations
Starting with **Streamer.bot v0.1.18**, it will now keep a record of any bit donations that it sees, this means if something comes in when it is not open, it will never know it happened (since there is no way to get past data from Twitch on this).

The total amount that has been seen is also shown in the user's information in the UI

> If you do a test event, this will be ignored and not added to whomever shows up for the test event.
{.is-info}

## DonorDrive Updates
The DonorDrive integration now pulls a list of known charities from the DonorDrive api, and uses this for the different provider types now.  This is mostly a quality of life improvement so you do not have to try and figure out the endpoint to use for a custom provider.

If the charity you are setting up, doesn't happen to be in the new list, you'll still be able to configure a custom provider
