## Details
### Simulated Events
Prior to **0.2.0**, one could test certain Twitch events from within the respective events tabs, and with the release of **0.2.0**, this was change to be able to test the `Triggers` directly.

With the addition of `Triggers`, this opened up the ability to have multiple actions triggered by the same event, so in order to test this, you would have to goto each action, and test the trigger manually.

With **0.2.2**, a new way of testing has been added, `Simulated Events`

`Simulated Events` are still initiated from a trigger's context menu, however, they will allow you to specify certain data (for instance, for a cheer, you pick the user, and specify the amount), and it will simulate this event application wide, so any triggers that match, will be run.

With this feature, also comes a way to not only search your local user cache, but, to also search against Twitch itself.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
The API used for searching only returns users who have streamed within the last 6 months, this is a limitation of the API, and is not possible to circumvent
