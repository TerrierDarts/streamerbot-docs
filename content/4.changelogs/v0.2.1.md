## Details

### Global User Variables
A note about `SetTwitchUsersVarById` and `SetYouTubeUsersVarsById`, these 2 C# methods are completely broken in **0.2.0** and should not be used, they will set all the variables for the users specified to the value passed.

### New C# Methods
```cs
void UnsetAllUsersVar(string varName, bool persisted = true);
```
```cs
QuoteData GetQuote(int quoteId);
int GetQuoteCount();
bool DeleteQuote(int quoteId);
```
The `QuoteData` class
```cs
public class QuoteData
{
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public string User { get; set; }
    public string Platform { get; set; }
    public string GameId { get; set; }
    public string GameName { get; set; }
    public string Quote { get; set; }
}
```
