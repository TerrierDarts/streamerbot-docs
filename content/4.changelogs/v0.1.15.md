## Details
### MIDI Support
Yes, you read the correctly, as of **Streamer.bot** v0.1.15, there will be MIDI support!

#### MIDI In
So, it will now be possible to run actions by using your MIDI Piano, and MIDI synth, oh, even your MIDI wind instrument, or anything that supports MIDI!

When adding an `Event`, you will be able to just press the key, turn the knob, or flick the wheel to have it auto populate all the settings for you.

This section is a WIP for information, but to get you started, here are some screenshots.

Add a new MIDI In device

Add a new MIDI event
![midi-03.png](/midi/midi-03.png)

Editing a MIDI event
![midi-02.png](/midi/midi-02.png)

To get started with MIDI follow these steps:

1. Add a Device, to do this, right click in the top section of the MIDI tab, and click Add
2. Pick your device from the drop down, and give it a name, and click Ok
3. Select the device you just added
4. Right click anywhere in the bottom list, and Add an event.
5. With the Add Event dialog open, you can press any of the keys on your device to have it fill in all the data for you and show an example of what the arguments will look like.

#### MIDI Out
The other side of MIDI, being able to send MIDI events out to your devices or DAWs.

Much like MIDI In, you create a device mapping within Streamer.bot, and you can use 1 of 3 new sub-actions to send MIDI events.

### New Twitch Broadcaster Scopes
* `channel:manage:raids`
* `channel:read:hype_train`
* `channel:read:goals`
* `moderator:manage:shield_mode`

### Twitch EventSub
Twitch updated there eventsub to support websocket connections, so after trialing it for a bit, I have added a new library to connect to this new service, and subscribe to various events.

#### Events that are now on EventSub
* Twitch Poll Events
* Twitch Prediction Events
* Twitch Channel Reward Events
* Twitch Follow Event
* Twitch Hype Train Events
* Twitch Charity Events (**improved and some new**)
* Twitch Channel Goals (**new**)
* Twitch Shield Mode (**new**)

#### Twitch Charity Events
Despite there already being support for Twitch Charity Donate, switching over to EventSub has introduced 3 new events (Started, Progress and Stop), as well as update the Donate event with more data.

#### Twitch Channel Goals
These are the goals you can configure, new follower goal, subscription goal, etc.  Now you can get udpates on these by way of 3 new events, Goal Begin, Goal Progress and Goal End

#### Twitch Hype Train Events
The hype train events have been altered slightly, and are no longer restricted to 5 levels, they can go on forever now.  The calculations for % complete have also been tweaked and hopefully are more accurate now.

#### Twitch Channel Reward Events
These events mostly remain unchanged, there is a slight re-organization of data, but is ver minimal.

#### Twitch Shield Mode Events
There are 2 new events for Twitch's Shield Mode, Begin and End. You can assign actions to these and have your stream react when your Shield Mode is enabled/disabled.

#### Twitch Prediction and Poll Events
Largely remain unchanged from the previous events.

### Service Status
With **Streamer.bot** v0.1.15 you can see, at a glance, if all your services are connected.

In the bottom right hand corner of **Streamer.bot**, there is now an indicator that shows if you're connected to your services.  If you click on this, you'll be presented with a detailed list of what is all connected, and, you can click on any of the services to be taken to the settings page for it.

### New Sub-actions
#### Twitch Follow Mode
Turn follow mode on, or off with the new sub-action, or by the new [C# method](#new-c-methods)

#### MIDI Out Sub-Actions
* Control Change
* Note On
* Generic Event

### New C# Methods
> There is no way, by API to send a raid yet, can only create, and cancel a raid

```csharp
bool TwitchStartRaidById(string userId);
bool TwitchStartRaidByName(string userName);
bool TwitchCancelRaid();
```

```csharp
void TwitchFollowMode(bool enabled = true, int duration = 0);
```

### OBS Websocket v5.x Batch Requests
You can now perform batch requests to a v5.x obs-websocket with OBS Raw
```json
{
  "haltOnFailure": false,
  "executionType": -1
  "requests": [
    {
      "requestType": "<string>",
      "requestData": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

Name | Description
----:|:------------
`haltOnFailure` | `True`/`False`, setting to true will stop processing requests if one fails, default is `False` and can be omitted
`executionType` | A number value, `-1`, `0`, `1`, `2` to indicate how to perform the requests, default is `-1` and can be omitted
`requests` | This is the array of your requests, each request takes on the same format as a single request
