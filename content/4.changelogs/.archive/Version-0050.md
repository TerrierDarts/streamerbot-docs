First off, Happy Birthday ChannelPointsHandler, you turned 1 on June 16th 2021, and as a celebration, a massive update, packed with new features and fixes all around.

Thank you everyone for deciding to use this piece of software that I write in my spare time, and sometimes, don't update for months ðŸ˜„ This community has been something special, and is very dear to my heart.  The VR community at large has had such an impact on me that I can't begin to thank you all enough for. From landing a job at a VR company (LIV), to finding that someone special in my life (Lithaya, if I may, I'd like to dedicate this release to you), and for many great friends along the way.

My DMs are always open, and, I don't bite (well, I try not to); while I may seem like I'm super busy all the time, you might be surprised, I do like playing games or anything else at times to ðŸ˜„ 

While I was waiting for the UI update for the next part, I thought maybe it was time to accelerate the renaming of ChannelPointsHandler, since it has turned into sooo much more then just that.

So, I now give you...

[![Streamer.bot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3193453/121985357-9c6fe500-cd62-11eb-9316-5cb66bc5b44b.png)](https://streamer.bot/)

One added note, since their have been quite a few asking about this, I have also setup a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nate1280) which should be going live the same day as this release, and will likely be evolving a bit over the next month as I try to figure things out.

{.changelog-new}

## Plugins
There is even a TouchPortal plugin built to support Streamer.bot! A StreamDeck plugin is also in the works.

## Execute C# Code
There is a new method that can be used:
```csharp
bool ExecuteMethod(string executeCode, string methodName);
```
Can be used to execute a method from another C# code action

## New Events
### Twitch - Present Viewers
Internally the bot has an event that fires every 5 minutes to get a list of viewer that are present in your channel, I have exposed this event, primarily for use in Execute C#, so you can write your own script for points tracking, and a full system surrounding that. An example of this may come later.

### Streamlabs - Donations
Much like twitch cheers, you can attach events for when someone donates to you. Say someone donates $6.66 well, you can now perform actions on specific amounts, ranges, or just in general. Note, the amount is in whatever currency your Streamlabs is setup to handle (or should be)

### Streamlabs - Merchandise Purchase
Do you host a merch store through Streamlabs, well, you can add an event when someone buys a t-shirt, or a fancy new mouse pad, or any other item that might be in your store.

### Twitch - Poll Created/Updated/Completed
These events will allow you do actions for when polls are used, do something fancy when a poll is created to alert your viewers that something is happening. And/or do something when a poll is finished.

### Twitch - Prediction Created/Update/Locked/Resolved/Canceled
These events can all occur during a prediction, and much like the polls, can add a dynamic flair to your stream when they occur.

### Twitch - Message
This event will occur every time a message comes through on twitch (this does not include the cheer event). Add some level of interactivity when messages happen, and/or write your own HTML based chat!

## Credits
Added a new test credits method, can be called from the Websocket server, or from the HTTP listener

## HTTP Server
Added a new network service, HTTP listener. This will allow you to make HTTP calls to get certain data, and also to run actions.

See [HTTP Server](/Servers-Clients/HTTP-Server) for full details and usage of this new capability

## Streamlabs!
You can now connect to your Streamlabs account and get donation and merchandise purchase events. To configure this, you will need to obtain your socket api token, and set this within the settings. There is no sign in authorization to do this at the moment due to how long it takes to get this approved.

2 new events are added for Streamlabs, and they are also included in the Websocket broadcast

## SLOBS Support!
A new addition to Streamer.bot, you can now control SLOBS the same way you can control OBS! Feature set should be parity, along with a whole new slew of Execute C# code methods to use for it as well.

## Twitch Polls and Predictions!
Create and resolve twitch polls right from within the app; assign actions to the creation/updating/ending of a poll. These events can also be broadcasted across the websocket server so you can create dynamic webpages to use within OBS/SLOBS

## BTTV/FFZ/Cheermotes
BTTZ/FFZ have been integrated into the Twitch chat library, so along side emotes that are sent within a twitch message, positions and locations of BTTV/FFZ emotes are also determined and passed along.

A side effect of this update, Pyramids now support BTTV and FFZ emotes!

## New Message Event!
Added a new event for all messages that come through Twitch, in combination with the BTTV/FFZ change, all relevant message data is now sent across in the websocket broadcasts. There is also a spot to assign actions to, but due to the nature of this event, I would highly recommend only an Execute C# action be used with it, as it will require more parsing then what is capable with the basic sub-actions.
