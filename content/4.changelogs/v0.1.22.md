* Fix Twitch authentication error (non-critical), caused by additional scope request.
{.changelog-fixes}

This is a hot-fix for 0.1.21 to fix a non-critical (workarounds were available) issue with Twitch Authentication, and requesting new scopes.  Seems I forgot to apply a change after updating the status indicator to still show the Twitch Broadcaster/Bot status after new scopes are required.
