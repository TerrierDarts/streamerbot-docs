## Important Notes for Twitch

Currently the Raid Event adds a `%raiderNames%` variable with information on who it thinks is part of the raid.  Because the `tmi` end point is being retired, this variable will no longer be available, as there are no replacement methods that can be used publicly.
> As of April 3rd, 2023, the tmi endpoint for obtaining a channel's list of chatters will be removed, **Streamer.bot** will be removing the aforementioned `%raiderNames%` variable sometime in March with an update.
