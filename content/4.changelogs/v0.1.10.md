## New C# Properties

Added the ability to get **Streamer.bot's** Twitch Client ID by using `CPH.TwitchClientId`, and the broadcaster's access token by using `CPH.TwitchOAuthToken`

I will not be adding the same capability to the YouTube information, since there are quotas involved.

## Twitch Ad Run Event

There is a new event that will be triggered when an ad is run on your channel.

> This event may get some tweaking over time as I can gather more data
