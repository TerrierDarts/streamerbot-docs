description: Assign Streamer.bot actions to keyboard shortcuts

## Overview
The Hot Keys tab enables configuration of global keyboard shortcuts to trigger [actions](/Actions)

This is not to be confused with the [Keyboard Press](/Sub-Actions/Keyboard-Press) sub-action. Hot-Keys are for recieving input, `Keyboard Press` is for sending inputs.

> While a `Hot Key` is defined, even if it is disabled, that key combination will be unavailable to **ALL** applications other than streamer.bot while the application is running.
This is why all Hot Keys require modifier keys to be set
{.is-warning}

> Where Left and Right versions of `Keys` or `Modifiers` exist no definition is made between them. To streamer.bot they will be treated equally
{.is-info}
