# Twitch Configuration
Configure the [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) streaming platform in Streamer.bot

## Overview
Streamer.bot integrates directly with Twitch to offer a set of first-class functionality.

## Configuration
You can configure both a **Broadcaster** *(required)*, and a **Bot** account *(optional)* for interacting with Twitch services.

### Broadcaster Account
A Broadcaster account is **required** to monitor your Twitch chat and receive all Twitch [events](/Platforms/Twitch/Events).

1. Press `Connect to Twitch` to sign in to your Twitch account and retrieve an OAuth2 token.
2. `Auto Connect` will set Streamer.bot to connect to twitch with the defined account on startup
3. `Auto Reconnect` instructs Streamer.bot to attempt reconnection in the case of any network interruption to the platform


### Bot Account
By default any [sub-actions](/Sub-Actions#main) will be sent through the Broadcaster account. If you want a secondary account to send these actions / messages it can be defined here in the same way


### Refresh Categories
Use this to pull a current list of available Twitch categories to be used as variables in [sub-actions](/Sub-Actions).

For example, you could automatically change scenes in [OBS Studio](/Broadcasters/OBS) if your Twitch category is changed to a specific game.
